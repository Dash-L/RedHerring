Our entry into the TechHacks TechNight2020 hackathon.

## About
The purpose of this project is to show how easily misinformation can be spread; one could easily fall for a false narrative.

### Misinformation
Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is usually intended to deceive, although it may be unintentional as well. This can be found in many places: video games, relationships, even the news and media.

### Misinformation vs Disinformation:
Disinformation is more propaganda than anything else. It is typically used for government or militia purposes. Disinformation is a weaponized version of misinformation. It pushes an agenda. Our project deals with misinformation.
